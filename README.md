# OpenCV-Tutorial

Welcome to the **OpenCV-Tutorial** repository! This repository is designed for anyone who wants to learn and explore the basics and advanced concepts of OpenCV through practical examples and projects.

Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your knowledge of computer vision, you'll find useful notebooks and code examples to get you started. The goal of this repository is to guide you through the fundamental operations of image and video processing, face detection, object tracking, and much more.
